Two majors blocker/step are :
Finding the compression routine and implementing the decompression/compression
Figuring the structure of map information


All figuring part are basicly trying to find out ROM location and structure
and involve lot of research (reading code/trace/poking memory)


First step :
Doing an enemy editor based on Assassin gamefaq info (hp/dmg/whatever)
Figuring where enemies sprite are located
This could take quite some time locating routines involved and where are the table for this

Figuring and implement gfx compression/decompression

Second step :
Map viewer
Trying to redraw a map:
Finding the information
Hoping the compression is the same than GFX

Adding other map information
- Figuring enemy placement
- Colision
- Special event (npc/trigger/pick up)

Probably exporting/importing all this stuff to Tiled format
to avoid writing an editor from scratch.

NPC dialog :
This should be easier
Figuring how NPC work
